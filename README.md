# AssemblyAI real-time transcriber MVP in C#

This is an experimental implementation of AssemblyAI's real-time transcription service in C#.
The goal is to get feedback early and iterate fast before it gets into our official C#/.NET SDK, once we have the SDK.
The data types are currently stubbed to have a minimal viable product and will be fully generated once we have the SDK.
